Phishing Website Detection is the process of identifying phishing websites, which are fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate ones in order to steal sensitive information such as login credentials or credit card numbers. The purpose of my model is to classify a website as either phishing or legitimate based on certain features of the website. 
To accomplish this, the model is trained on a dataset of labeled websites, where each website is represented by a set of features such as the URL, the website's content, and the website's structure. Once trained, the model can take in the feature set of a new website and predict whether it is phishing or legitimate.
First of all, we cleaned data by removing high correlated columns. For that we use CramerV's correlation method (for categorical variables, all variables were represented by -1 phishing, 0 suspicious and 1 legitimated). After preparing data to train, we spiltted it. 
To train data we used 2 methods called Decision Tree and KNN algorithm.
